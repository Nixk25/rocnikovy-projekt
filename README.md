<h1>Cookify 🍳</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
Cookify is a web application that I developed as part of my university’s annual project. The project started in the first semester, initially focusing on the frontend. However, I continued to work on it during the second semester, adding all the necessary features. Cookify serves as a recipe-sharing platform, allowing users to add, favorite, and update recipes. Users can also register and log in to the application.

<h2>Tech Stack 🛠️</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and various component libraries (e.g., ShadcnUI).</li>
<li>Backend: Node.js (for the server-side logic).</li>
<li>Database: MongoDB (for storing recipe data).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features 🌟</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recipe Management: Users can add new recipes, edit existing ones, and view recipe details.</li>
<li>Favorites: Users can mark recipes as favorites for quick access.</li>
<li>User Authentication: Registration and login functionality for personalized experiences.</li>
<li>Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process 🚀</h2>

The project began with the idea of creating a recipe-sharing platform. I started by designing the user interface using Figma and VisilyAI. The frontend development went smoothly, but the backend posed a challenge. As someone with limited backend experience, I had to learn and implement server-side logic, database interactions, and user authentication.

<h2>Learnings 🧠</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full-Stack Development: Integrating frontend and backend components.</li>
<li>Database Management: Storing and retrieving recipe data from MongoDB.</li>
<li>Authentication: Implementing user registration and login functionality.</li>
<li>Problem-Solving: Overcoming challenges during development.</li>
</ul>
